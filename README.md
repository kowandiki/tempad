## TemPad

A notes app that does not store any notes built using Flutter. The purpose of this app is solely for temporary in person written communication. This aims to avoid issues associated with using traditional notes app for this type of communication, which can result in either tediously slow communication, or tens of thousands of notes, which can slow devices down considerably.

### Usage

The app consists primarly of a large text box with buttons to increase or decrease the font size, speak the written text using the selected TTS engine, and clear all text with an associated undo. Additionally, removing focus from the app will delete all text, but can be restored with the undo button.

### Installation

This app will not be put on any app distribution services like google play, fdroid, or the app store. You may rely on the [releases page](https://github.com/kowandiki/tempad/releases) for installable .apk files for android devices. Alternatively, you can clone this repository and compile it yourself.

Support for other platforms theoretically is available, however these platforms will not be tested, and no releases for these platforms will be made. Should you wish to use this app on other platforms, you will need to compile it yourself.
