## TemPad

TemPad is an AAC app designed for individuals who essentially want a temporary notepad instead of the more common approach of using tiles or pictures to convery thoughts. It is designed to be highly customizable since different users may have different preferences or limitations. The app is currently only tested and confirmed to work on Android, however iOS support is being added. This app is not yet available on Google Play, the App Store, or F-Droid, however links will be available here once the app is available on them.

### Usage

The main page consists of a large text box. Tapping anywhere on it (by default the white background) will bring up a keyboard if it isn't brought up automatically. The +/- buttons on the side can be used to increase or decrease the font size respectively. The megaphone button will play all the text that is written out using the phones default TTS engine, unless another one is selected in the settings menu. The camera button will bring up the photo gallery when tapped, or the camera when held. The garbage button will delete all text in the current workspace, and the undo button will restore the previously deleted text. The gear button will open the settings menu.

The bar at the bottom of the page has controls for moving forward or backward one word or character at a time, as well as a button for changing between up to 5 workspaces. Each workspace can act as a way of creating temporary prepared phrases, such as if you wanted to order a specific item at a restaurant but are waiting for someone to take your order.

This app by default will learn from how you write and try to predict the next word you will say. The skip forward 1 word button will insert that predicted word when pressed. The predicted words may take some time to start popping up regularly however as it is entirely based on your own writing, and is trained from scratch.

### Privacy

This app is fully offline, does not require an internet connection, and does not share anything you write with anyone. It does by default store unordered word pairs of what you write, however this can be disabled and deleted at any time through settings or by clearing the app cache respectively.

Additionally, by default the app will clear all text you have written any time the app loses focus. This is to stop you from accidentally sharing personal information with someone you are trying to talk to in case you were previously having a sensitive conversation. The text can be restored by pressing the undo button. This feature can be disabled in settings.

### Languages

English is currently the only fully supported language. The fonts support the latin, greek, and cyrillic alphabets. As a result the app is useable for most other languages, however all the setting descriptions are only available in english.

### Installation

Currently, the only way to install the app is to compile it into an apk and install it yourself on an android device that allows sideloading. APK releases will be available [here](https://github.com/kowandiki/tempad/releases) when the app is ready for a 1.0 release. The app will eventually also be available for download on Google Play, the App Store, and F-Droid, and links to.
